## <font color='blue'>**Introduction**</font> 

Understanding and controlling the interaction between light and matter 
is crucial for physics and engineers. Despite ongoing efforts to develop numerical
techniques and deep learning approaches for forward simulation and inverse scattering problems, efficiently 
solving for three-dimensional (3D) complex systems remains challenges.

**SolverM:** is an accurate and fast Solver for Maxwell's equations.
        
    
- SolverM enables ultrafast simulations through GPU accelerations without requiring discretization of the additional time dimension or involving eigen problems. 
                               
- SolverM is effcient for simulating both subwavelength gratings and large-scale structures, delivering high performance for accurate applications in optical metrology, computational lithography. It also enables efficient simulation of large-scale
         metasurfaces and facilitates the design of photonic structures
   
       
## <font color='blue'>**Benchmark**</font> 
The following sections provide examples and benchmarks for SolverM. Validation of SolverM is 
conducted through published documentations and comparison with electromagnetic software such 
as <a href="https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"target="_blank"> 
Meep (open source-FDTD). </a> and  
<a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/solver/"target="_blank"> 
Tidy3D (GPU-FDTD).</a>  

However, it's important to note that **comparisons are relative**, as variations in numerical 
efficiency can arise from differences in simulation methods, programming languages, 
simulation targets, computer resources... Our primary objective is to develop efficient 
solutions for complex 3D nanostructures.

In highlighted benchmarks, SolverM showcases impressive performance, being two-order and three-order 
magnitude faster in <a href="#showcase1"> plasmonic sensor</a> and  
<a href="#showcase2"> lithography imaging</a> applications.
SolverM completes the theoretical inverse problem of <a href="#showcase3"> 2D-gratings</a>
just 1 second. For <a href="#showcase4"> micro-nanostructure arrays</a>, SolverM requires 2s for simulating 
optical reponses. 


## <font color='blue'>**Periodic structures**</font> 

<!--In simulating periodic structures, Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) is commonly used due 
to its efficiency in handling the inherent periodicity of such structures. However, RCWA's 
requirement of solving eigenproblems may present challenges when tackling complex 3D multilayers.

In the following examples and benchmarks, we showcase SolverM's outperformance of RCWA 
in forward simulations and solving inverse problems for periodic structures.-->

### Plasmonic sensor 

We demonstrate a plasmonic sensor simulation in 
<a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-22-36201&id=461916"target="_blank"> 
on Schlipf and Inga A. Fischer, Optics express, 2021. </a>
The plasmonic sensor is composed of metallic nanoarrays on bottom homogeneous layers.
               
In SolverM, a structure is presented through its layer components.                        
A grating layer is defined by three attributes: mask, base material, 
and grating material, while a homogeneous layer is defined by mask and 
base material. In the plasmonic sensor, the metallic nanoarray is defined:                        
                                            
```python

layer['mask']=SM.Geometry.Circle(CD=Diameter,Cx=Lx/2,Cy=Ly/2)  # nanohole       
layer['grating']={'eps': e_water,'name':'water'}               # nanohole in water
layer['base']={'eps': e_Al,'name':'Al'}  


```   
                   
and the homogeneous layer is defined:           



```python

layer['mask']=SM.Geometry.Homo()  
layer['base']={'eps': e_SiO2,'name':'SiO2'}


```   
                     
To verify the geometry before performing simulations, SolverM offers 
visualization of the defined geometry in the XY, XZ, and YZ planes. 
Nanostructure dimensions are presented in pixel length (user define).                          
In the XY plane, SolverM provides the option to display either all layers 
or specific layers of interest within a structure
                
                         
```python

SM.Geometry.XY(Geometry,pos_layer=[0,1,2,3])  
                       
```   
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/XY_plasmonic_sensor.png" width="80%">
</p>
                     
```python

SM.Geometry.XZ_YZ(Geometry)  
                    
``` 
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/XZ_YZ_plasmonic_sensor.png"  width="80%">
</p>                 
                         
**Simulation time:** 
SolverM requires less than 1s for *standard resolution*, and 5s for *fine resolution* 
to compute optical responses at 81 wavelength points: Reflectance, Transmittance and Absorbance of 
the 3D-plasmonic structure in water. SolverM is two orders of magnitude  faster than

### Plasmonic Lithography
In this benchmark, we implement a plasmonic lithography imaging model. 
The plasmonic structure utilized is adapted from

A customized mask is used to define the T-shaped pattern.

```python

layer_lth['mask_uf']=customized T-mask           
layer_lth['grating']={'eps': e_PMMA,'name':'PMMA'}
layer_lth['base']={'eps': e_Cr,'name':'Cr'}

</p>                                    

**Simulation time:**
SolverM requires less than 1s to compute the electric field of the 3D-plasmonic lithography structure,  
making it 1000 times faster than Ansys and 400 times faster than

### Mueller Matrix Ellipsometry-Si gratings
In the example,  we reproduce the Mueller matrix obtained from ellipsometry measurement 
of 2D Si gratings, adapted from
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315804617_Comparison_of_spectroscopic_Mueller_polarimetry_standard_scatterometry_and_real_space_imaging_techniques_SEM_and_3D-AFM_for_dimensional_characterization_of_periodic_structures"target="_blank"> 
Martino et al.,SPIE Proc,2008.</a>

</p> 

Mueller matrix ellipsometry is a non-dectructive, non-Contactct measurement technique to characterize 
nanostructures.
By measuring all polarizing states of the sample, Mueller matrix ellipsometry is very 
sensitive to optical responses and has been extensively used for optical metrology applications.

The simulation of Mueller matrix ellipsometry  is essential for solving inverse 
problems to reconstruct nanostructures from the measurement. 

**Simulation time:** 
SolverM requires about 1s to compute the Mueller matrix of AOI=45, Azimuth
=[0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90].

### 2D-Photoresist

In the given example, SolverM is used to solve the theoretical inverse problem of spectroscopic 
ellipsometry applied to 2D photoresist structures in
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040609015001224"target="_blank"> 
Liu et al.,Thin Solid Films,2015.</a>  


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Resist_2D.png" width="40%">
</p> 

The optical properties of BARC and photoresist are calculated using Forouhi model and Tauc-Lorentz 
model, respectively. The Mueller matrix in the following figure is simulated based on 
a structure with a photoresist thickness of 115 nm, a BARC thickness of 310 nm, and a critical 
dimension (CD) of 200 nm. It is noted that at azimuth=0, the off-diagonal 
Mueller ellements are zero. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Resist_2D_MM.png" width="60%">
</p> 

For the theorical inverse problem, initial parameters are randomly chosen, and the 
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is employed for iterative optimizations. The theoretical 
inverse problem involving three parameters typically requires approximately 1 second to converge.
However,it is noted that this benchmark does not reflect practical applications 
where challenges such as measurement noise, complex geometries arising from fabrication 
constraints... must be addressed.

## <font color='blue'>**Large structures**</font> 

<!--Simulating large structures continues to pose challenges, primarily due to the extensive 
simulation domain involved. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is commonly 
employed due to its simplicity and efficient parallelization on GPUs. However, FDTD necessitates 
additional time-domain considerations that may require substantial computational resources
and result in time-consuming simulations, particularly for large structures.

In the following examples and benchmarks, we showcase SolverM's capability in addressing 
the simulation of large nanostructures.-->

### GaN_GradientMetasurface        
In the benchmark, we reproduce the diffraction efficiency of μm-scale 3D metasurface arrays in

### <font color='red'>3D Visualization</font> 

I'm currently developing a 3D interactive visualization tool for nanostructures using Plotly. 
While Plotly's Mesh3D is used for representing cubes and Surface for cylinders, I'm encountering 
an issue with legends where their shapes differ. In this example, the legend for 'air' and the
legend for 'SiN' are different. The reason is that Plotly automatically differentiates the 
legends based on the plot type (Mesh3D and Surface).

Do you have any suggestions on how to customize legend shapes in 3D Plotly

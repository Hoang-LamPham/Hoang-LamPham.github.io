# <font color='blue'>**Introduction**</font> 

Understanding and controlling the interaction between light and matter 
is crucial for physics and engineers. Despite ongoing efforts to develop numerical
techniques and deep learning approaches for forward simulation and inverse scattering problems, efficiently 
solving for three-dimensional (3D) complex systems remains challenges.

**SolverM:** overcomes existing challenges to peform fast and rigorous simulations.      
    
SolverM is effcient for simulating both subwavelength gratings and large-scale structures, providing high performance for accurate applications in optical metrology, computational lithography. 
It also enables efficient simulation of large-scale metasurfaces and facilitates the design of photonic structures.

 
       
# <font color='blue'>**Tutorial**</font> 
The following sections provide examples and benchmarks for SolverM. Validation of SolverM is 
conducted through published documentations. However, it's important to note that **comparisons are relative**, as variations in numerical 
efficiency can arise from differences in simulation methods, programming languages, 
simulation targets, computer resources... Our primary objective is to develop efficient 
solutions for complex 3D nanostructures.

## <font color='blue'>**Basic**</font>   

‘SM.setup()’ function is used to setup simulation conditions by passing key parameters such as
wavelength_range: list of incident wavelengths, LxLy: periodic lengths, NxNy: simulation domain,
angle: incident angle and azimuth...

```python
device=torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
SM=SolverM()
SM.setup(wavelength_range=wavelength_range,
         LxLy=[Lx,Ly],          # periodic length
         NxNy=[Nx,Ny],          # simulation domain  
         angle=[AOI,Azimuth],   # degree
         e_ref=e_ref,           # reflectance medium
         e_trn=e_trn,           # transmittance medium
         source=source,
         device=device,
         dtype=torch.complex128
         )
```   

A nanostructure is defined by a list of all component layers. A grating layer is specified by
mask, grating material, medium material:

```python
layer['mask']=SM.Geometry.Rectangle(Wx=Wx,Wy=Wy)  
layer['grating']={'eps': e_Si,'name':'Si'}
layer['medium']={'eps': e_air,'name':'air'}  
layer['h']=h

``` 

For a complicated mask that is not in the library (Circle, Rectangle...), a user-defined
mask is used:
```python
layer['mask']=user-defined mask 
```

A homogeneous layer is simply defined:
```python
layer['mask']=SM.Geometry.Homo()  
layer['medium']={'eps': e_Si,'name':'Si'}
layer['h']=h
```

The SolverM also provides geometry visualization to help users verify nanostructures before
performing simulations. A detailed example of the visualization is presented in the next section.

The main part of the simulation is very simple:
```python
SM.sim (Geometry)
```

Then, we can calculate diffraction coefficients, optical responses: reflectance, transmittance,
absorbance, electromagnetic field....

## <font color='blue'>**Plasmonic sensor **</font>

In the example, SolverM is used to simulate optical responses—Reflectance, Transmittance, and Absorbance of a 
3D plasmonic biosensing in water.The plasmonic structure consists of Al nanoholes on homogeneous 
layers of SiO2, Si, and Ge. More details can be found in **Rigorous coupled-wave analysis of a multi-layered plasmonic 
integrated refractive index sensor** by
<a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-22-36201&id=461916"target="_blank">

In SolverM, a structure is presented through its layer components.                        
A grating layer is defined by three attributes: mask, base material, 
and grating material, while a homogeneous layer is defined by mask and 
base material. The plasmonic structure is defined:                        
                                            
```python

e_m=[e_Al,e_SiO2,e_Si,e_Ge] #   
material_name=['Al','SiO2','Si','Ge']

Geometry=[]
for lth in range(NL):
    layer_lth={}      
    if lth ==0:
        layer_lth['mask']=SM.Geometry.Circle(CD=Diameter)        
        layer_lth['grating']={'eps': e_water,'name':'water'}
        layer_lth['medium']={'eps': e_m[lth],'name':material_name[lth]}  
        layer_lth['h']=h_Sim[lth]
    else:
        layer_lth['mask']=SM.Geometry.Homo()  
        layer_lth['medium']={'eps': e_m[lth],'name':material_name[lth]}
        layer_lth['h']=h_Sim[lth]
    Geometry.append(layer_lth)    


```     
                     
To verify the geometry before performing simulations, SolverM offers 
visualization of the defined geometry in the XY, XZ, and YZ planes. 
Nanostructure dimensions are presented in pixel length (user define based on simulation domain).                          
In the XY plane, SolverM provides the option to display either all layers 
or specific layers of interest within  structure
                                      
                 
The color_uf is used to customize visualization with user-defined colors.  

```python
color_uf=['lime','brown','cyan','blue','gray']

SM.Geometry.XY(Geometry,pos_layer=[0,1,2,3],color=color_uf)  
SM.Geometry.XZ_YZ(Geometry,color=color_uf)                     
```

<p align="center"> <img src="images/plasmonic_XZ_YZ_color_uf.png" width="80%"></p>

                     
**Simulation:** 
SolverM requires less than 1s for *standard resolution*, and 5s for *fine resolution* 
to compute optical responses at 81 wavelength points: Reflectance, Transmittance and Absorbance of 
the 3D-plasmonic structure in water. SolverM is two orders of magnitude  faster than than the method

## <font color='blue'>**Mueller Matrix Ellipsometry-Si gratings **</font>
In the example,  we reproduce the Mueller matrix obtained from ellipsometry measurement 
of 2D Si gratings, adapted from **Comparison of spectroscopic Mueller polarimetry, standard 
scatterometry, and real space imaging techniques (SEM and 3D-AFM) for dimensional characterization 
of periodic structures**

Mueller matrix ellipsometry is a non-dectructive, non-contactct measurement technique to characterize 
nanostructures.By measuring all polarizing states of the sample, Mueller matrix ellipsometry is very 
sensitive to optical responses and has been extensively used for optical metrology applications.

The simulation of Mueller matrix ellipsometry  is essential for solving inverse 
problems to reconstruct nanostructures from experimental measurements. 

In the example, SolverM is used to perform simulation of Muelller matrix from two sources: TM and TE modes,
over a broad wavelength range, and wide range of azimuth angles.  

**Simulation:** 
SolverM requires about 1s to compute the Mueller matrix of AOI=45, Azimuth
=[0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90].

## <font color='blue'>**Mo/Si multilayer stacks**</font>  

<p align="center"><img src="images/Mo_Si_f.png", width="40%"></p> 

SolverM is used to compute the reflectivity of a molybdenum/silicon (Mo/Si) multilayer stack, 
commonly employed in current EUV systems. The stack consists of 40 alternating layers of Mo
and Si, with Mo layers 3 nm thick and Si layers 4 nm thick. 
The refractive indices of Mo and Si are 0.91943 + 0.00663i and 0.99875 + 0.00183i, respectively.

Reflectivity is calculated as a function of wavelength, ranging from 11 to 16 nm, 
at an incident angle of 6°. At the operating wavelength of 13.5 nm, the reflectivity reaches 
approximately 70%

## <font color='blue'>**Au nanoantenna**</font> 

In this example, we simulate the reflectance/transmitance spectrum of arrays of gold nanobars periodically 
(square lattice) placed on a silicon substrate in the research article by 
**Angle-and polarization-dependent collective excitation of plasmonic nanoarrays for surface enhanced 
infrared spectroscopy** by [H.Altug et al.2011](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-19-12-11202&id=214241)

<p align="center"><img src="images/Au_antenna_f.png" width="40%"></p> 

The structure is designed for the normal-incidence peak response of the Amide I protein at wave number of 
1650 cm-1. The figure below shows the reflectance of Au nanoantenna with periodic lengths of Px=Py=1750nm, 
Wx=870nm, Wy=230nm, h=70nm. The refractive index of Au is taken from 
[Olmon et al.,  2012](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235147), 
while the refractive index of Si is 3.21 for all incident wavenumbers.

<p align="center"><img src="images/Au_antenna.png" width="30%"></p> 


## <font color='blue'>**EUV mask**</font>  

A typical extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask consists of a TaN absorber layer on Mo/Si multilayers 
to optimize optical efficiency. Simulating the near field of EUV masks with complex patterns is 
crucial for computational lithography, as it enables the study of mask effects such as asymmetric shadowing, wavefront deformation, 
and image contrast variations.

<p align="center"> <img src="images/EUV_mask_f.png" width="60%" ></p> 

SolverM is used to simulate the electric field of an EUV mask with an absorber layer at an angle of 
incidence (AOI) of 6°, and feature dimensions of wx=wy=50nm,The layer thickness is 
h=50nm with a periodic length of Px=Py=150nm. The absorber layer is placed on 40 pairs of Mo/Si multilayers,
where the Mo layer is 3nm thick and the Si layer is 2nm thick. At an incident wavelength of 13.5 nm, 
the refractive index of the TaN absorber is 0.9385+0.03776𝑖
Mo is 0.91943+0.00663i, and Si is 0.99875+0.00183i.

**Simulation time**: accelerated by GPU, SolverM computes the near field of the EUV mask in less than 1 second.

## <font color='blue'>**GaN super cell**</font>       
<p align="center"><img src="images/GaN_f.png" width="60%" ></p> 
In this example, SolverM is used to simulate the diffraction efficiency of μm-scale 3D metasurface arrays in  
**Global optimization of metasurface designs using statistical learning methods**                   
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53878-9"target="_blank"> 
by Elsawy et al., Scientific Reports, 2019.</a>. The structure consists GaN cylindrical nanoridges on 
top of Al2O3 substrate.     

A customized mask is used to define the GaN super cell pattern.

```python

layer_lth['mask']=customized mask           
layer_lth['grating']={'eps': e_GaN,'name':'GaN'}
layer_lth['medium']={'eps': e_air,'name':'air'}  
                    
```   

SolverM displays the GaN super cell in pixels (1 pixel =1 nm) for the simulation. 

<p align="center"><img src="images/GaN_XY.png" width="60%" ></p>


**Simulation time:** 
It takes approximately 2s to compute the Transmittance and Diffraction Efficiency for 
the first order of the TM polarized wave.
